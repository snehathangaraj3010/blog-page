      <h2>Enterprise Resource Planning </h2>
      <h5>ERP is an abbreviation for Enterprise Resource Planning and means, the techniques and concepts for integrated management of businesses as a whole from the viewpoint of the effective use of management resources to improve the efficiency of enterprise management. ERP packages are integrated (covering all business functions) software packages that support the above ERP concepts. Originally, ERP packages were targeted at the manufacturing industry and consisted mainly of functions for generally planning and managing the core business such sales management, production management, accounting and financial affairs, etc. However, in recent years, adaptation not only to the manufacturing industry, but also to diverse types of industry has become possible and the

expansion of implementation and use has been progressing on a global level. ERP software is designed to model and automate many of the basic processes of a company, from finance to the shop floor, with the goal of integrating information across the company and eliminating complex, expensive links between computer systems that were never meant to talk to each other.

ERP software is a mirror image of the major business processes of an organization, such as customer order fulfillment and manufacturing. Its success depends upon reach-a circumscribed ERP system is not better than the legacy system it replaces. In many cases, it is worse because the old code at least was written specifically for the company and the task. The set of generic processes of the ERP system, produce the dramatic improvements that it is capable of, only when used to connect parts of an organization and integrate its various processes seamlessly. For example, when a warehouse in Noida enters a customer order, that data should automatically flow to others in the company who need to see it-to the finance department at headquarters in Mumbai and to the manufacturing department in Chennai. The lure of information integration struck a chord with CEOS and CFOs the primary targets of ERP vendors and sales of ERP took off in the early '90s.

COMMON ERP MYTHS

There are a lot of myths that surround the concept, infrastructure, implementation and practice of enterprise resource planning. Very often people are not willing to adopt ERP because of these wrong notions. In this section we will see some of the most common myths about ERP and will try to demystify them.

ERP means More Work and Procedures

Properly implementing and managing an ERP system is not an easy task. The transition period from the traditional system or manual processing to ERP is difficult as new skills have to be learned,new procedures and processes have to be followed, and so on. Many employees think that ERP will add more work, make the work more difficult and will force unnecessary procedures. Transformation from the old system to the ERP system is a difficult process. However, if the management and the implementation team do their job properly, ensuring that the employees are told what to expect and given proper training, then the transition can be smooth. Once the employees get used to the new system, they will understand the potential benefits and the effort saved through automation of tasks and jobs. Today's ERP tools automate many of the repetitive, monotonous and tedious procedures. tasks and processes thus making the life of the employees a lot easier.

ERP will Make Many Employees Redundant and Jobless

Another popular misconception about ERP systems is that its implementation will make many jobs redundant (because of the automation) and hence, many employees will lose their jobs. A properly implemented ERP system will automate many tasks in the organization. This does not mean that the ERP systems will make people redundant. there will be changes in job descriptions</h5>
